# Modernized Food Recipe Website (Project 2)

(Created mid October 2023 and completed by end of October 2023)

This project serves as an updated version to my Project 1 Food Website (found also on my GitHub) in a more clean and nicer modern version by using a web template! There are five different pages through the sites. The first page consits of an introduction to the site. On top of the main page, I added a useful JavaScript script that changes every day to the date your viewing the website. The site is also more modernized and easier to view throughout the other pages. From the second to the fourth page, it includes the recipes. On the second page is the breakfast recipe, third page is a lunch recipe, and foruth page is a dinner recipe. Lastly, I added a contact page where you can contact me by filling out the form and clicking send message! Have fun viewing my site!

To view the website easily and quickly without having to download files, here is a link I created to click below to an easy access in viewing my site through raw.githack.com.
